### Project

---

Having spent a large amount of time throughout my life working in the hospitality industry I am aware of how important a good rep is when it comes to the business you're working in. That's where the idea to create my own version of trip advisor came in.

Being able to store information on local places and leave reviews and ratings is something that helps businesses bring in new customers. Having managed my own account in real life for the company I work for I understand the significance of this.

### Installation and set up

---

restaurant Rater is made up of two corresponding repos in the frontend and backend

1. To get started you will need to create a new project directory that contains two directories for our frontend and backend

2. Navigate into our client directory so you can then fork and clone the git repo via the terminal

- https://github.com/alexbotha/phase-3-react-frontend

3. Once you have checked you are in the correct project directory you will need to install all packages

- npm install

4. Once you have installed all packages you will be able to launch the app locally by running the command

- npm start

5. Now we have the frontend up and running we need to get the server side sorted. Open up a seperate terminal and navgiate into the server project directory. Once you've done that fork and clone the git repo that contains the backend code

- https://github.com/alexbotha/phase-3-sinatra-react-project

6. You will need to then install all the gem packages listed in the repos gemfile. To do this run the following command in the terminal

- bundle install

7. To run the backend server you can type the following command in the terminal

- bundle exec rake server

8. Test the data is being correctely requested from the frontend and returned from the back end via the Sinatra API routes

- It is worth noting that if your client side is running before your server side then there will be no data to display. Please make sure both are running in order to visually see the data on the frontend.
